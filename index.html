               <p id="rule"><b> Forbidden City </b>,Chinese (Pinyin) Zijincheng or (Wade-Giles romanization) Tzu-chin-ch’eng, imperial palace complex at the heart of<a>Beijing (Peking), China</a>. Commissioned in 1406 by the Yongle emperor of the Ming dynasty, it was first officially occupied by the court in 1420. It was so named because access to the area was barred to most of the subjects of the realm. Government functionaries and even the imperial family were permitted only limited access; the emperor alone could enter any section at will. The 178-acre (72-hectare) compound was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987 in recognition of its importance as the center of Chinese power for five centuries, as well as for its unparalleled architecture and its current role as the Palace Museum of dynastic art and history. 
                  The architecture of the walled complex adheres rigidly to the traditional Chinese geomantic practice of feng shui. The orientation of the Forbidden City, and for that matter all of Beijing, follows a north-south line. Within the compound, all the most important buildings, especially those along the main axis, face south to honor the Sun. The buildings and the ceremonial spaces between them are arranged to convey an impression of the great imperial power while reinforcing the insignificance of the individual. This architectural conceit is borne out to the smallest of details—the relative importance of a building can be judged not only from its height or width but also by the style of its roof and the number of figurines perched on the roof's ridges.

                  <p id="rule">The plan of the forbidden city responds to ancient Chinese principles: <b>Yin &Yang and Feng Shui</b>.  
                   <a>Yin &Yang</a> are the two primordial breaths of life, they are derived from Qi. Contrary to what is usually thought in the West, Yin and Yang are not opposites but opposites: They complement each other, eventually cancel each other out, but do not oppose each other. They represent symmetry, and therefore order, still this important notion in China. One is used to highlight the other. In the Forbidden City the most important buildings are oriented towards the South, the face of the Yang. For example, in the group of 3 central pavilions the supreme harmony pavilion, which was the throne room, was in the south with the Pavilion of Harmony Preserved, in the North, was a banquet hall. She was associated with Yin. Between the two, the middle pavilion symbolizes balance. Moreover, in the private part of the north, the six Eastern palaces were reserved for the heir princes, they were associated with the side Yang, facing the rising. The older people, the widows of the previous emperor, for example, but also the former concubines, were in the six western palaces, on the Yin side. In the same way, to preserve the harmony of the city, the palaces of Literary Glory are in the South-East while the Palace of Military Bravery is in the North-West. It is therefore a subtle balance that has been respected for the construction of the Forbidden City.
                      Feng Shui, which has been translated by the word "Geomancy", is the study of the flow of energy passing through a given place in order to conclude the arrangements to be made for the quality of life on this site. The Chinese, from ancient times, had established that flows of energy roamed all living beings for the purpose of irrigating them. They drew a medicine of their own, medicine based on the study of the meridians of the body.
                      The Forbidden City should therefore receive all possible care in the establishment of these flows. First of all, it was necessary to protect oneself from the north winds, and the situation of Peking, in a plain, between two rivers, did not seem ideal, but the presence of mountains to the North, the Yan Shan (Swallow's Mountains) , allowed to cut these harmful flows. Also inside the city of Beijing a mountain was built to stop again these flows at the northern wall of the Forbidden City, this is the role of the mountain coal. The palace was protected by another device, the river with golden waters. This river runs through the city from north-east to south-west through the south of the courtyard that bears his name.
